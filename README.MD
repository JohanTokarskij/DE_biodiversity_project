# Wildlife Conservation Analysis

This project analyzes wildlife observations and species data to provide insights into the conservation status of different species and their observations in national parks. It uses Python with Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization. 

## Key Questions Addressed:
1. **Distribution of Conservation Status:**
   - Visualizes the distribution of conservation statuses for species.

2. **Endangerment by Species Category:**
   - Examines whether certain species categories are more likely to be endangered.

3. **Most Spotted Species by Park:**
   - Identifies species most frequently observed in each park.

## Data Sources:
- 'observations.csv': Contains wildlife observation data.
- 'species_info.csv': Contains information about various species.

## Conclusions:
The analysis offers valuable insights into wildlife conservation efforts, including the distribution of conservation statuses and species endangerment. It also highlights the most commonly observed species in each park.

## Note:
Ensure the necessary datasets are available in the working directory before running the code. This project can be expanded for more in-depth analysis.
